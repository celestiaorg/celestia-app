# ADR 002: QGB ValSet

## Status

Implemented

## Context

To accommodate the requirements of the [Quantum Gravity Bridge](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/76efeca0be1a17d32ef633c0fdbd3c8f5e4cc53f/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol), We will need to add support for `ValSet`s, i.e. Validator Sets, which reflect the current state of the bridge validators.

## Decision

Add the `ValSet` and `ValSetConfirm` types of messages in order to track the state of the validator set.

PS: The `ValsetConfirm` has been updated in `adr-005-qgb-reduce-state-usage`. Please take a look at it to know how we will be handling the confirms.

## Detailed Design

Since the QGB is only a one-way bridge and does not transfer assets, it doesn't require the portions of the gravity module that recreate the state from the bridged chain. We only need to keep things relating to signing over the validator set (such as `MsgSetOrchestratorAddress` and `MsgValsetConfirm`) and relayer queries (such as `ValsetConfirm` and `GetDelegateKeyByOrchestrator`).

It works by relying on a set of signers to attest to some event on Celestia: the Celestia validator set.

The QGB contract keeps track of the Celestia validator set by updating its view of the validator set with `updateValidatorSet()`. More than 2/3 of the voting power of the current view of the validator set must sign off on new relayed events, submitted with
[`submitDataRootTupleRoot()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/980b9c68abc34b8d2e4d20ca644b8aa3025a239e/ethereum/solidity/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L328).
Each event is a batch of `DataRootTuples`, with each tuple representing a single data root (i.e. block header). Relayed tuples are in the same order as Celestia block headers.
For more details, check the data commitment ADR.

Finally, if there are no validator set updates for the unbonding window, the bridge must halt.

### When are validator sets created

1. If there are no valSet requests, create a new one
2. If there is at least one validator who started unbonding in the current block. (we persist the last unbonded block height in `hooks.go`)
   This will make sure the unbonding validator has to provide an attestation to a new ValSet
   that excludes him before he completely unbonds. Otherwise, he will be slashed.
3. If the power change between validators of CurrentValSet and the latest valSet request is > 5%

### Message types

We added the following message types:

#### Bridge Validator

The `BridgeValidator` represents a validator's ETH address and its power.

```protobuf
message BridgeValidator {
   // Voting power of the validator.
   uint64 power = 1;
   // Ethereum address that will be used by the validator to sign messages.
   string ethereum_address = 2;
}
```

#### ValSet

`Valset` is the Ethereum Bridge Multsig Set, each qgb validator also maintains an ETH key to sign messages, these are used to check signatures on ETH because of the significant gas savings.

```protobuf
message Valset {
   // Unique number referencing the `ValSet`.
   uint64 nonce = 1;
   // List of BridgeValidator containing the current validator set.
   repeated BridgeValidator members = 2 [ (gogoproto.nullable) = false ];
   // Current chain height
   uint64 height = 3;
}
```

#### MsgSetOrchestratorAddress

`MsgSetOrchestratorAddress` allows validators to delegate their voting responsibilities to a given key. This key is then used as an optional authentication method for signing oracle claims.

```protobuf
message MsgSetOrchestratorAddress {
   // The validator field is a celesvaloper1... string (i.e. sdk.ValAddress)
   // that references a validator in the active set
   string validator = 1;
   // The orchestrator field is a celes1... string  (i.e. sdk.AccAddress) that
   // references the key that is being delegated to
   string orchestrator = 2;
   // This is a hex-encoded 0x Ethereum public key that will be used by this
   // validator on Ethereum
   string eth_address = 3;
}
```

#### ValSetConfirmfix last e2e tests

`MsgValsetConfirm` is the message sent by the validators when they wish to submit their signatures over the validator set at a given block height. A validator must first call `SetOrchestratorAddress` to set their Ethereum's address to be used for signing. Then, using `EndBlocker()`, the protocol makes a `ValsetRequest`, the request is essentially a messaging mechanism to determine which block all validators should submit signatures over. Finally, validators sign the `validator set`, `powers`, and `Ethereum addresses` of the entire validator set at the height of a `Valset` and submit that signature with this message.

If a sufficient number of validators (66% of voting power):

- have set Ethereum addresses and,
- submit `ValsetConfirm` messages with their signatures,

it is then possible for anyone to view these signatures in the chain store and submit them to Ethereum to update the validator set.

```protobuf
message MsgValsetConfirm {
   // Unique number referencing the `ValSet`.
   uint64 nonce = 1;
   // Orchestrator `celes1` account address.
   string orchestrator = 2;
   // Ethereum address, associated to the orchestrator, used to sign the `ValSet`
   // message.
   string eth_address = 3;
   // The `ValSet` message signature.
   string signature = 4;
}

```

### ValSetRequest Handling

`ValSetRequest`s are created at the `EndBlocker` function:

```go
func EndBlocker(ctx sdk.Context, k keeper.Keeper) {
    ...
}
```

#### Get the latest valset and unbonding height

We start by getting the latest valset, unbonding height, and also initializing the power difference between valsets.

```go
latestValset := k.GetLatestValset(ctx)
lastUnbondingHeight := k.GetLastUnBondingBlockHeight(ctx)
significantPowerDiff := false
```

#### Check if there was a significant power difference between valsets

If the previous valset is not null, then we had a previous set of validators defining a certain power.
We check if the current valset power is significantly different from the previous one. If so, we set the `significantPowerDiff` to true.

The significance of the power difference is calculated using a pre-defined constant. Currently, it is defined as:

```go
// SignificantPowerDifferenceThreshold the threshold of change in the validator set power
// that would need the creation of a new valset request.
const SignificantPowerDifferenceThreshold = 0.05
```

For more information on the normalization of power, check [here](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/df46d122da5f1fab1bd99bfb2bfcf9002f5bc154/x/qgb/types/validator.go#L101
).

#### Create a ValSet

Finally, if one of the following conditions holds:

- There were no valsets already committed to.
- The power difference between the previous valsets and the current one is significant.
- A validator started unbonding in the current block height.

We set a new valset request to be signed by the network and ultimately submitted to the QGB contracts.

```go
if (latestValset == nil) || (lastUnbondingHeight == uint64(ctx.BlockHeight())) || significantPowerDiff {
    // if the conditions are true, put in a new validator set request to be signed and submitted to Ethereum
    k.SetValsetRequest(ctx)
}
```

### ValSetConfirm Processing

Upon receiving a `MsgValSetConfirm`, we go for the following:

#### ValSet check

We start off by checking if the `ValSet` referenced by the provided `nonce` exists. If so, we get it. If not, we return an error:

```go
valset := k.GetValset(ctx, msg.Nonce)
if valset == nil {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "couldn't find valset")
}
```

#### Check the address and signature

Next, we check the orchestrator address:

```go
orchaddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Orchestrator)
if err != nil {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "acc address invalid")
}
```

Then, we verify if the signature is well-formed, and it is signed using a private key whose address is the one sent in the request:

```go
err = k.confirmHandlerCommon(ctx, msg.EthAddress, msg.Orchestrator, msg.Signature)
if err != nil {
    return nil, err
}
// persist signature
if k.GetValsetConfirm(ctx, msg.Nonce, orchaddr) != nil {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrDuplicate, "signature duplicate")
}
```

The `confirmHandlerCommon` is an internal function that provides common code for processing signatures:

```go
func (k msgServer) confirmHandlerCommon(ctx sdk.Context, ethAddress string, orchestrator string, signature string) error {
    _, err := hex.DecodeString(signature)
    if err != nil {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "signature decoding")
    }

    submittedEthAddress, err := types.NewEthAddress(ethAddress)
    if err != nil {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "invalid eth address")
    }

    orchaddr, err := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(orchestrator)
    if err != nil {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "acc address invalid")
    }
    validator, found := k.GetOrchestratorValidator(ctx, orchaddr)
    if !found {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrUnknown, "validator")
    }
    if err := sdk.VerifyAddressFormat(validator.GetOperator()); err != nil {
        return sdkerrors.Wrapf(err, "discovered invalid validator address for orchestrator %v", orchaddr)
    }

    ethAddressFromStore, found := k.GetEthAddressByValidator(ctx, validator.GetOperator())
    if !found {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrEmpty, "no eth address set for validator")
    }

    if *ethAddressFromStore != *submittedEthAddress {
        return sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrInvalid, "submitted eth address does not match delegate eth address")
    }
    return nil
}
```

And, then check if the signature is a duplicate, i.e. whether another `ValSetConfirm` reflecting the same truth has already been committed to.

#### Persist the ValSet confirm and emit an event

Lastly, we persist the `ValSetConfirm` message and broadcast an event:

```go
key := k.SetValsetConfirm(ctx, *msg)
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
    sdk.NewEvent(
        sdk.EventTypeMessage,
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, msg.Type()),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeyValsetConfirmKey, string(key)),
    ),
)
```

### SetOrchestratorAddress Processing

Upon receiving a `MsgSetOrchestratorAddress`, we go for the following:

#### Basic validation

We start off by validating the parameters:

```go
// ensure that this passes validation, checks the key validity
err := msg.ValidateBasic()
if err != nil {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, "Key not valid")
}
ctx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(c)

// check the following, all should be validated in validate basic
val, e1 := sdk.ValAddressFromBech32(msg.Validator)
orch, e2 := sdk.AccAddressFromBech32(msg.Orchestrator)
addr, e3 := types.NewEthAddress(msg.EthAddress)
if e1 != nil || e2 != nil || e3 != nil {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, "Key not valid")
}

// check that the validator does not have an existing key
_, foundExistingOrchestratorKey := k.GetOrchestratorValidator(ctx, orch)
_, foundExistingEthAddress := k.GetEthAddressByValidator(ctx, val)

// ensure that the validator exists
if foundExistingOrchestratorKey || foundExistingEthAddress {
    return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(types.ErrResetDelegateKeys, val.String())
}
```

Then, verify that neither keys is a duplicate:

```go
// check that neither key is a duplicate
delegateKeys := k.GetDelegateKeys(ctx)
for i := range delegateKeys {
    if delegateKeys[i].EthAddress == addr.GetAddress() {
        return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, "Duplicate Ethereum Key")
    }
    if delegateKeys[i].Orchestrator == orch.String() {
        return nil, sdkerrors.Wrap(err, "Duplicate Orchestrator Key")
    }
}
```

#### Persist the Orchestrator and Ethereum address and emit an event

Lastly, we persist the orchestrator validator address:

```go
k.SetOrchestratorValidator(ctx, val, orch)
```

Then, we set the corresponding Ethereum address:

```go
k.SetEthAddressForValidator(ctx, val, *addr)
```

And finally, emit an event:

```go
ctx.EventManager().EmitEvent(
    sdk.NewEvent(
        sdk.EventTypeMessage,
        sdk.NewAttribute(sdk.AttributeKeyModule, msg.Type()),
        sdk.NewAttribute(types.AttributeKeySetOperatorAddr, orch.String()),
    ),
)
```
