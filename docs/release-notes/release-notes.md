# Release Notes

This guide provides notes for major version releases. These notes may be helpful for users when upgrading from previous major versions.

## v4.0.0

### Node Operators (v4.0.0)

#### Multiplexer

Celestia-app v4.0.0 introduces support for a [multiplexer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/e5d5ac6732c55150ea3573e17bec162fe836e0c6/multiplexer) that makes it easier for node operators to run a consensus node that can sync from genesis. The multiplexer contains an embedded celestia-app v3.x.x binary that will be used to sync the node from genesis. After the chain advances to app version v4, the multiplexer will stop routing requests to the embedded celestia-app v3.x.x binary and will instead begin routing requests to the celestia-app v4.x.x binary. Binaries that are installed from source (e.g. via `make install`) or via the pre-built binaries attached to the release will include the multiplexer. To install Celestia without the multiplexer, you can use the `make install-standalone` target. Note that the standalone binary will only be able to run on networks that have already upgraded to app version v4.

#### `rpc.grpc_laddr`

The `rpc.grpc_laddr` config option is now required when running the celestia-app binary with the multiplexer. This option can be set via CLI flag `--rpc.grpc_laddr tcp://0.0.0.0:9098` or in the `config.toml`:

```toml
[rpc]

# TCP or UNIX socket address for the gRPC server to listen on
# NOTE: This server only supports /broadcast_tx_commit
grpc_laddr = "tcp://0.0.0.0:9098"
```

## v3.0.0

### Node Operators (v3.0.0)

#### Enabling BBR and MCTCP

Consensus node operators must enable the BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) congestion control algorithm. See [#3774](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/pull/3774).
If using Linux in Docker, Kubernetes, a VM or bare-metal, this can be done by calling

```sh
make enable-bbr
```

command on the host machine.

#### Configure Node for V3

Consensus node operators should update several configurations for v3. This can be done by calling:

```sh
make configure-v3
```

If the config file is not in the default spot, it can be provided using:

```sh
make configure-v3 CONFIG_FILE=path/to/other/config.toml
```

**Alternatively**, the configurations can be changed manually. This involves updating the mempool TTLs and the send and receive rates.

- Configuring Bandwidth Settings
  - Update `recv_rate` and `send_rate` in your TOML config file to 10MiB (10485760)
- Extend TTLs
  - Update `ttl-num-blocks` in your TOML config file to 12

#### Signaling Upgrades

- Upgrades now use the `x/signal` module to coordinate the network to an upgrade height.

The following command can be used, if you are a validator in the active set, to signal to upgrade to v3:

```bash
celestia-appd tx signal signal 3 <plus transaction flags>
```

You can track the tally of signalling by validators using the following query

```bash
celestia-appd query signal tally 3
```

Once 5/6+ of the voting power have signalled, the upgrade will be ready. There is a hard coded delay between confirmation of the upgrade and execution to the new state machine.

To view the upcoming upgrade height use the following query:

```bash
celestia-appd query signal upgrade
> An upgrade is pending to app version 3 at height 2348907.
```

For more information refer to the module [docs](../../x/signal/README.md)

### Library Consumers (v3.0.0)

- Namespace and share constants in the `appconsts` package were moved to [celestiaorg/go-square](https://github.com/celestiaorg/go-square). See [#3765](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/pull/3765).

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/releases/tag/v2.0.0)

### Node Operators (v2.0.0)

If you are a consensus node operator, please follow the communication channels listed under [network upgrades](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/participate#network-upgrades) to learn when this release is recommended for each network (e.g. Mocha, Mainnet Beta).

Consensus node operators are expected to upgrade to this release _prior_ to the Lemongrass hardfork if they intend to continue participating in the network. The command used to start the [consensus node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/consensus-node#start-the-consensus-node) or [validator node](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/validator-node#run-the-validator-node) will accept an additional `--v2-upgrade-height` flag. See [this table](https://docs.celestia.org/how-to-guides/network-upgrade-process#lemongrass-network-upgrade) for upgrade heights for each network.

Consensus node operators should enable the BBR (Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip propagation time) congestion control algorithm. See [#3812](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/pull/3812).

### Library Consumers (v2.0.0)

If you are a library consumer, a number of the Go APIs have changed since celestia-app v1.x.x. Some of the notable changes are:

- Code pertaining to the original data square was extracted to [celestiaorg/go-square](https://github.com/celestiaorg/go-square).
  - celestia-app v1.x had a shares package. celestia-app v2.x uses [go-square/shares](https://github.com/celestiaorg/go-square/tree/c8242f96a844956f8d1c60e5511104deed8bc361/shares)
  - celestia-app v1.x had a blob.types package with `CreateCommitment` function. celestia-app v2.x uses `CreateCommitment` function from the [go-square/inclusion](https://github.com/celestiaorg/go-square/tree/c8242f96a844956f8d1c60e5511104deed8bc361/inclusion).
- celestia-app v1.x had a lot of functionality included in the signer. celestia-app v2.x splits a txClient from the signer. See [#3433](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/pull/3433).
