# End-to-End Testing

Celestia uses the [knuu](https://github.com/celestiaorg/knuu) framework to orchestrate clusters of nodes in a network for end-to-end testing. This relies on Docker and a kubeconfig (in `~/.kube/config`) to access the Kubernetes cluster.

End-to-end tests pull docker images from `ghcr.io/celestiaorg/celestia-app-standalone` and `ghcr.io/celestiaorg/celestia-app`. These are automatically published when tagging a new release or when opening a pull request. If you wish to manually test a specific commit, you can manually publish the image by first running `make build-ghcr-docker` (from the root directory) and then running `make publish-ghcr-docker`. You must have permission to push to the `ghcr.io/celestiaorg/celestia-app-standalone` repository.

## Usage

**Prerequisite: Requires a kubeconfig file.** Access to the specific `kubeconfig` file used by this project is limited to internal contributors only.

You can run the End-to-End tests using either of the following commands:

```shell
go run ./test/e2e
```

```shell
make test-e2e
```

To run a specific test, you can pass the name of the test as a command-line argument. For example, to run the "E2ESimple" test, you would use either of the specified commands:

```shell
go run ./test/e2e E2ESimple
```

```shell
make test-e2e E2ESimple
```

**Optional parameters**:

- `KNUU_TIMEOUT` can be used to override the default timeout of 60 minutes for the tests.

## Observation

Logs of each of the nodes are posted to Grafana and can be accessed through Celestia's dashboard (using the `test` namespace).

### Metrics

To view the metrics from the testnet, you should set the `GRAFANA_ENDPOINT`, `GRAFANA_USERNAME`, and `GRAFANA_TOKEN` environment variables. This uses Prometheus alongside the Jaeger and Otlp Exporter.

## Running locally

It is also possible to run the whole workloads locally using minikube.

### Backup existing configuration

By default, the instructions below will overwrite your existing cluster configuration. To back up your configuration:

```shell
cp ${HOME}/.kube/config ${HOME}/.kube/config_backup
```

This will back up your default kubernetes configuration. If you use a different directory/file, and you plan on referencing it when creating the minikube cluster below, please back it up.

### Install minikube

Minikube is required to be installed on your machine. If you have a linux machine, follow the [minikube docs](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/). If you're on macOS ARM, this [tutorial](https://devopscube.com/minikube-mac/) can be helpful to run it using qemu.

### Create namespace

The command in [usage](#usage) specifies an environment variable `KNUU_NAMESPACE` to the value `test`. This namespace will need to be created before running that command:

```shell
kubectl create namespace test
```

If another namespace is to be used, please create it using the same command while changing `test` to your target namespace.

### Check the logs

After you start the E2E tests, you can check if you have the validators running:

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace test
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
timeout-handler-09e1a426-jwm7n   1/1     Running   0          2m18s
timeout-handler-921a1b93-52g6d   1/1     Running   0          40m
timeout-handler-c3442f46-lvxw2   1/1     Running   0          37m
timeout-handler-f5ccc2c9-7hld2   1/1     Running   0          34m
val0-3a7e2e1e-zs8h5              1/1     Running   0          60s
val1-9b802df8-tcvnb              1/1     Running   0          51s
val2-91b57a4d-ht57t              1/1     Running   0          42s
val3-dcc2ef6c-cg8k5              1/1     Running   0          32s
```

The logs can be checked using:

```shell
kubectl logs --namespace test -f <pod_name>
```

With `<pod_name>` being a pod name like `val0-3a7e2e1e-zs8h5`.

### Destroy the pods

By default, the pods will be killed automatically after 60 minutes. However, if you want to clean up the cluster manually and destroy all the replica sets in the `test` namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete replicasets --all --namespace test
kubectl delete pods --all --namespace test # to force the destruction of pods which are in the termination state
```

Note: This will delete all the created replica sets and pods in the default kubernetes cluster under the `test` namespace. Make sure to run it against the correct cluster and double-check the replica set list that is going to be destroyed using this command:

```shell
kubectl get replicasets --namespace test
```

And the list of pods:

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace test
```

Also, you will have dangling persistent volume claims and persistent volumes. If you want to remove those too:

```shell
kubectl delete pvc --all --namespace test
kubectl delete pv --all --namespace test
```

### Restoring old cluster configuration

If you followed the [backup your existing cluster configuration](#backup-existing-configuration) section, you can restore your previous cluster configuration using:

```shell
cp ${HOME}/.kube/config_backup ${HOME}/.kube/config
```

## Known issues

### `no configuration has been provided, try setting KUBERNETES_MASTER environment variable`

This happens when the kubernetes configuration is missing. Knuu expects the cluster configuration to be in `${HOME}/.kube/config`. Make sure to put the cluster configuration in that file.

### `failed to start testnets: node val0 failed to start: error waiting for instance 'val0-d0f34ee4' to be running: timeout while waiting for instance 'val0-d0f34ee4' to be running`

This usually happens locally when minikube is unable to start the pods which can happen if the pvcs/pvs are not correctly allocated, the cluster nodes don't have enough resources to run the workloads, or the used virtualization engine is unable to start the pods.

If you run into this issue, try running the tests using the docker engine, increasing the cluster's nodes to two nodes, and increasing the resources needed:

```shell
minikube delete # delete the existing cluster so that we're able to start a new one with a different vm driver.
minikube start --driver docker --network socket_vmnet --nodes 2 --cpus=4 --memory=4g
```

The above command assumes the user's machine has more than eight cores, more than 8gb of RAM, and also docker has access to all those resources.

NB: This command requires the docker daemon to be up. Make sure to start docker before executing it.
