// The x/zkism module is an implementation of a Hyperlane Interchain Security Module.
// This module is a custom implement of an ISM (Interchain Security Module). It's purpose is to provide a means for proving execution
// of a remote chain through a standardised interface, the ISM. Thus, we leverage the transport semantics of the Hyperlane messaging
// protocol, while providing a custom security mechanism.
