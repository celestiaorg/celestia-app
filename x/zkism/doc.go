// The x/zkism module is a custom implementation of a Hyperlane Interchain Security Module (ISM).
// It's purpose is to provide a means for proving execution of a remote chain through a standardised interface, the ISM.
// Thus, we leverage the transport semantics of the Hyperlane messaging protocol, while providing a custom security mechanism.
