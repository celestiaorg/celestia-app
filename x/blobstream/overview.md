# Overview

Blobstream is a one way bridge from Celestia to EVM chains. It provides a way for rollups using Celestia for Data Availability (DA), and an EVM chain as a settlement layer, to prove on-chain that the rollup data was correctly posted to Celestia and verify fraud proofs otherwise. These types of rollups are discussed in the [Quantum Gravity Bridge: Secure Off-Chain Data Availability for Ethereum L2s with Celestia](https://blog.celestia.org/celestiums) blog post.

Blobstream implementation consists of three components: The [state machine](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream), the [orchestrator-relayer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer), and the [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts).

## [State machine](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream)

The state machine is the `blobstream` module implementation. It is responsible for creating [attestations](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/0a7154538e6b47ca806e9f4b3fd9ff1581213099/x/blobstream/types/attestation.go#L10-L18) which are signed by [orchestrators](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/orchestrator.md). Each Celestia validator is expected to also run an orchestrator. [Relayers](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/relayer.md) periodically query the Celestia state for attestations and submit them to the Blobstream smart contract deployed on some EVM chain.

There are two types of [attestations](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/0a7154538e6b47ca806e9f4b3fd9ff1581213099/x/blobstream/types/attestation.go#L10-L18): [valsets](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/376a1d4c0f321f12ba78279d2bd34fc6cb5e6dc2/proto/celestia/qgb/v1/types.proto#L18-L33) and [data commitments](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/376a1d4c0f321f12ba78279d2bd34fc6cb5e6dc2/proto/celestia/qgb/v1/types.proto#L35-L55).

All attestations have a [`nonce`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/8ae6a84b2c99e55625bbe99f70db1e5a985c9675/x/qgb/types/attestation.go#L16) field that defines the order in which the attestations are generated. This nonce is stored in the Blobstream smart contract as per [ADR-004](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-004-qgb-relayer-security.md#decision), and is used to order attestation submissions on the EVM chain.

### [Valsets](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/0a7154538e6b47ca806e9f4b3fd9ff1581213099/x/blobstream/README.md?plain=1#L18)

A [valset](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/0a7154538e6b47ca806e9f4b3fd9ff1581213099/x/blobstream/README.md?plain=1#L18) represents a validator set snapshot. It contains a list of validators' EVM addresses along with their [Blobstream staking power](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream#validator-power-normalization). It enables the Blobstream smart contract to track the state of the Celestia validator set. This is necessary so that the Blobstream smart contract can determine when a 2/3 threshold has signed that a particular data hash has been made available on Celestia.

A valset is [generated](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream#valset-handler) inside the state machine. It is then queried, signed, and submitted to the [Blobstream P2P network](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/pull/66) by orchestrators. After more than 2/3rds of the Celestia validator set have submitted their signatures, [relayers](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/relayer.md) relay the attestation to the Blobstream smart contract along with the signatures to be [verified](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L172-L211) and eventually [stored](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L266-L268).

The Blobstream smart contract keeps track of the [last validator set hash](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L44-L45) and its corresponding [power threshold](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L46-L47). This way, the contract will always be able to verify if attestations were signed using the correct Celestia validator set, and if the provided signatures represent a majority.

### [Data commitments](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream#data-commitments)

A [data commitment](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/tree/main/x/blobstream#data-commitments) is an attestation type representing a request to commit over a set of blocks. It provides an end exclusive range of blocks for orchestrators to sign over and propagate in the Blobstream P2P network. The range is defined by the param [`DataCommitmentWindow`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/fc83b04c3a5638ac8d415770e38a4046b84fa128/x/qgb/keeper/keeper_data_commitment.go#L44-L50).

The data commitment is a Merkle tree over a sequential set of blocks. These blocks are represented as a tuple of the [data root](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/blob/6933af1ead0ddf4a8c7516690e3674c6cdfa7bd8/rpc/core/blocks.go#L549), and the [height](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/blob/6933af1ead0ddf4a8c7516690e3674c6cdfa7bd8/rpc/core/blocks.go#L548). This commitment can be queried from core using the [`DataCommitment`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-core/blob/6933af1ead0ddf4a8c7516690e3674c6cdfa7bd8/rpc/core/blocks.go#L210-L227) query and allows generating Merkle inclusion proofs for any blob in any block in the set.

When an orchestrator sees a newly generated data commitment, it queries the previous valset and checks whether it's part of its validator set. Then, the orchestrator signs the new data commitment and submits that signature to the [Blobstream P2P network](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/pull/66). Otherwise, it ignores it and waits for new attestations.

After the relayer finds more than 2/3rd signatures of that data commitment, it relays the commitment along with the signatures to the Blobstream smart contract where they get [verified](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L172-L211). Then, the smart contract [saves](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L331-L332) the commitment to the [state](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L50-L51) thus allowing for Merkle-based inclusion proof verification for any blob posted to any committed block.

## [Orchestrator-relayer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer)

The [orchestrator-relayer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer) contains the implementation of the Blobstream orchestrator and relayer.

### [Orchestrator](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/orchestrator.md)

An [orchestrator](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/orchestrator.md) is the software responsible for querying the state machine for new attestations, signs them, and then submits them to the Blobstream P2P network.

At startup, it [loads](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/orchestrator.md#evm-key) the EVM private key corresponding to the address used when creating the validator. Then, it uses it to sign the attestations digests before submitting them to the P2P network.

An attestation digest is a bytes array containing a digest of the attestation relevant information. More on this in the [hashes format](#hashes-format) section.

The orchestrator generally needs access to the validator's RPC/gRPC endpoints. However, it still can use public ones if needed. Its only hard requirement is having access to the specific private key for the target validator. Otherwise, the signatures will be invalid and the validator could get slashed in future versions.

### [Relayer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/relayer.md)

A [relayer](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/main/docs/relayer.md) is the software responsible for querying the signatures of a validator set from the P2P network and aggregating them into a format that the [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol) understands.

It uses the previous valset to that attestation to know which validators should sign. Then, it looks for all of those signatures.

When the relayer finds more than 2/3rds of the signatures, it immediately relays them to the Blobstream smart contract to be persisted, and starts again.

For a [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol) to not halt, it needs at least one relayer relaying signatures to it regularly. Otherwise, the Blobstream contract will be out of sync and will not be able to commit to new data.

## [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/blobstream-contracts)

The [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol) is the source of truth for the rollups using Celestia as DA. It allows proving/verifying that data was posted to the Celestia blockchain.

In order to reflect the Celestia chain data, the [Blobstream smart contract](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol) keeps track of the validator set changes, via valset updates, and commits to batches of block information, via data commitments.

### Validator set changes

In order to submit a validator set change, the Blobstream smart contract provides the [`updateValidatorSet()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L213-L273) `external` method that takes the previous valset nonce, the new one's nonce, its power threshold and its hash, along with the actual validator set and the corresponding signatures, as `calldata` to be verified. Then, it [persists](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L266-L268) the nonce, the valset hash and the threshold in state so they can be used for future valset and data commitment updates.

### Batches

The batches in the Blobstream smart contract refer to the `data root tuple root`s described above. These are submitted using the [`submitDataRootTupleRoot()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L275-L337) `external` method. This latter takes the new batch nonce, its corresponding valset, the `data root tuple root`, along with the actual validator set and their corresponding signatures as `calldata`. Then, it verifies the signature and [persists](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L331-L332) the new data root tuple root to the state along with the new nonce.

### Hashes format

The digest created/verified in the Blobstream smart contract follow the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard for hashing data.

#### Valset digest

A valset digest is created inside the [`domainSeparateValidatorSetHash()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L137-L154) method. It is the `keccak256` hash of the concatenation of the following fields:

- `VALIDATOR_SET_HASH_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`: which is defined as a [constant](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/Constants.sol#L4-L6).
- The valset nonce: the [universal nonce](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-004-qgb-relayer-security.md#decision) of the attestation representing that validator set change.
- The power threshold: the threshold defining 2/3rds of the validator set.
- The validator set hash: The keccak256 hash of the validator set which is calculated using the [`computeValidatorSetHash()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L131-L135) method.

#### Data commitment digest

A data commitment digest is created inside the [`domainSeparateDataRootTupleRoot()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L156-L170) method. It is the `keccak256` hash of the concatenation of the following fields:

- `DATA_ROOT_TUPLE_ROOT_DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`: which is defined as a [constant](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/Constants.sol#L8-L10).
- The data commitment nonce: the [universal nonce](https://github.com/celestiaorg/celestia-app/blob/main/docs/architecture/adr-004-qgb-relayer-security.md#decision) of the attestation representing that data commitment.
- The data root tuple root: which is the commitment over the set of blocks defined [above](#data-commitments).

### Signatures

The signature scheme used for signing the above hashes follow the [EIP-191](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-191) signing standard. It uses the `ECDSA` algorithm with the `secp256k1` curve. So, the orchestrator uses the keystore to [generate](https://github.com/celestiaorg/orchestrator-relayer/blob/09ebfdc312c0d9e08856fb98cfd089e956ab7f3a/evm/ethereum_signature.go#L18-L28) these signatures.

The output signature is in the `[R || S || V]` format where `V` is `0` or `1`. This is defined in the Blobstream smart contract using the [Signature](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L17-L21) struct.

These signatures are then verified in the smart contract using the [`verifySig()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L124-L129) method.

## Security assumptions

The security of the Blobstream relies on an honest majority of the Celestia validator set. This assumption indicates that more than 2/3s of the voting power follows each [block validity rule](../../specs/src/block_validity_rules.md). Additionally, over 2/3s of the voting power sign valid validator set updates and data commitments, as outlined above.

If more than 1/3rd of the validator set stops running their orchestrators, then the Blobstream halts. And, if more than 2/3rds sign invalid data, then the Blobstream contract will commit to invalid data. The only recovery from such a state is to revert to social consensus, potentially slashing the guilty validators and redeploying the smart contracts.

## Slashing

We still don't support slashing for equivocation, liveness  or invalid signatures. However, if anything were to happen to the bridge, we would be able to social slash the corrupt validators and redeploy the contract.

Future versions of the Blobstream will support slashing. It will be enforced via the use of [vote extensions](https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/blob/v0.38.0/spec/abci/abci%2B%2B_methods.md#extendvote).

## Proofs

To prove that data was posted to an EVM chain, we have the following method: [`verifyAttestation()`](https://github.com/celestiaorg/quantum-gravity-bridge/blob/3cef3f5dfd37c3086fa40a6324f144595726dc16/src/QuantumGravityBridge.sol#L339-L358). This allows to verify that a data root tuple was committed to by the Blobstream smart contract.

For the remaining proofs, i.e. shares to data root tuples proofs, the app is currently able to generate and verify them. However, these are still not supported at the smart contract level. Future works will focus on this.
