# `x/minfee`

## Abstract

The `x/minfee` module is responsible for managing the gov-modifiable parameter `NetworkMinGasPrice` introduced in app version 2. `NetworkMinGasPrice` ensures that all transactions adhere to this network minimum threshold, which is set in the genesis file and can be updated via governance proposals.
