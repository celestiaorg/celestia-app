# CODEOWNERS: <https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/>

# Everything goes through the following "global owners" by default. Unless a later
# match takes precedence, the "global owners" will be requested for review when
# someone opens a PR. Note that the last matching pattern takes precedence, so
# global owners are only requested if there isn't a more specific codeowner
# specified below. For this reason, the global owners are often repeated in
# directory-level definitions.

# directory owners
# NOTE: the directory owners should include the global owners unless the global
# owner is fully deferring ownership to the directory owner
